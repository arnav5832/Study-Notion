StudyNotion is a full-stack EdTech platform designed to provide a complete online learning experience for both students and instructors. The platform enables instructors to create, manage, and publish courses, upload video lectures, and monitor enrolled students, while students can browse available courses, purchase them securely via Razorpay integration, and access course content through a personalized dashboard.

The application features secure user authentication using JWT, role-based authorization, and efficient media handling through Cloudinary. The frontend is built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI, while the backend is developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to ensure scalability and performance. The project is deployed using Netlify for the frontend and Render for the backend, demonstrating real-world production deployment practices.
